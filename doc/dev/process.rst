Overview
========

Development is any modification of the Project, which is complex enough to
warrant tracking its internal states. For example, elimination of the spelling
errors within a documentation file is too simple to be covered by the processes
described in this document, whereas development of a new major feature is not.

Examples of types of development are:

* new feature;
* bug fix;
* technical debt elimination;
* documentation creation or update;
* refactoring.

Process
=======

The overall development process structure is the following:

Initiation (INIT)
-----------------

The modification is proposed. The origin of modification request can be:

  - marketing or sales;
  - feature request from a user (internal or external to Seagate);
  - bug report;
  - report of a defect in or an inconsistency between process, architecture,
    design, code, documentation, tests, *etc*.;
  - change in requirements;
  - change in timelines, deadlines, available development resources or
    schedules;

At the initiation state, the modification can be described imprecisely or
indirectly. For example, a bug report "the system crashes while executing
operation X in environment Y" is implicitly a request to "modify the system so
that it doesn't crash while executing the operation X in environment Y".

The modification is always associated with a group of *initiators*. As the
outcome of initiation state, an *owner* is assigned to the modification.

**Owner assignment process**: to be defined. Depends on the modification type.

Clarification (CLARIFY)
-----------------------

At this state, the scope and intent of the modification are clarified between
the initiators and the owner. This is an iterative process, that completes when
the owner has enough data to start analysis. The data include descriptions of
features, informal requirements, informal use cases, bug reproducibility
conditions, *etc*.

Analysis (ANALYSIS)
-------------------

The modification is analysed in terms of the Project software
structure. Possible implementations are considered and documented. Prototypes
are created and experiments are ran to select the implementation strategy to
follow. An analysis produces:

* a list of software components that have to be changed,
* a high level description of changes, their intent, scope and interaction.

At this point it is decided whether the modification falls under the development
process described in this document. If it does, a unique meaningful *name* is
assigned to it and a development *tracking file* is created in doc/dev/.

The list of *stakeholders* is defined at this point and recorded in the tracking
file. Stakeholders are peoples or groups interested in this development, their
consent is required for state transitions of the development process. A
stakeholder has a rôle (or rôles) with the development, for example,
"architect", "designer", *etc*. The list of rôles and their responsibilities in
the process is described **elsewhere**.

All decisions, problems and artefacts associated with the development are
recorded in the tracking file.

Requirements (REQS)
-------------------

The formal list of requirements is defined and recorded in the tracking
file. This list is formed and maintained according to the *requirements tracking
process* (defined elsewhere). Requirements are used to systematically find
dependencies or inconsistencies between the developments and the existing code
base.

Architecture (ARCH)
-------------------

If the analysis (or any other) stage determines that changes to the Project
architecture are needed, the *architecture modification process* is
invoked. This process determines which parts of the architecture need to be
altered, added or removed; develops a version of the architecture including this
modification and checks it for consistency.

If changes to the architecture are needed, the designs (high and low level),
code and documentation that have to be changed (to reflect changes in the
architecture) are identified and listed in the tracking file.

If changes to the architecture change assumptions about external dependencies
(software, hardware and environment), these changes in assumptions are
identified and listed in the tracking file.

All changes to the internal and external entities have to be discussed with and
agreed by the appropriate stakeholders. The outcomes of these discussions are
recorded in the tracking file.

The outputs of the architecture stage:

* agreed modifications to the architecture (both as a new architecture document
  and as a "delta");

* agreed modifications to the assumptions about external dependencies.

Planning (PLAN)
---------------

During the planning phase, the development is sub-divided into a list of
development *tasks*. Examples of tasks are:

* detailed-level design inspection;
* integration of the system tests for the new feature.

Each task is assigned a meaningful name unique within the development. If
necessary, a tracking file doc/dev/development.task is created to record
progress of the task execution, otherwise task progress is recorded within the
development tracking file.

The outcome of planning, recorded in the tracking file, is:

* a list of development tasks,
* dependencies between tasks,
* an integration plan, which specifies how the modifications will be merged in
  the Project,
* QA plan, which specifies how the QA team will test the tasks,
* deployment plan, which specifies how tasks are deployed in the field,
* estimates for task phases (development, test, integration, QA and deployment),
* assignment of task phase responsibilities to developers, architects and
  managers,
* an execution schedule

Execution (EXEC)
----------------

During execution phase, development tasks are executed concurrently, according
to the task execution process specified below.

Periodically, development stakeholders perform a *checkpoint* to assess
alignment with the planned schedule and necessary adjustments to the tasks.

A task execution process can got *stuck* at any stage. This happens when further
task execution is impossible for any reason, for example:

* during task requirement collection or design phase it becomes clear that the
  task would take significantly more effort to complete than originally
  estimated;

* high or detailed level design uncovers an inconsistency in other design or
  architecture;

* change in requirements requires significant change to task designs or code.

When a task is stuck, and this cannot be fixed at the checkpoint level, the
development process is reset to an earlier stage, *e.g.*, architecture,
requirements or planning, to address the issue with the task.

Task execution process for a typical task is the following.

Task requirements (TREQ)
++++++++++++++++++++++++

Task requirements are extracted from the development requirements and refined.

High-level design (HLD)
+++++++++++++++++++++++

A high-level design is created and recorded in doc/hld. A link to the HLD file
is placed in the tracking file.

The resulting HLD should contain enough information to start the DLD. An HLD
contains, among other things, functional and logical specification of the task,
*testing*, *integration* and *deployment* plans (see
doc/hld/hld-template.rst.in).

High-level design intermediate review (HLDIR)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creation of a complex HLD can be periodically informally reviewed (**by ...**)
to assure that it goes in the right direction.

High-level design inspection (HLDINSP)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

An HLD is inspected. Inspection comments are recorded. The HLD authors discuss
and address the comments. The HLD is updated. The inspection process is repeated
until all found issues are addressed.

Detailed-level design (DLD)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A detailed-level design is created as a set of skeleton source files with embedded
documentation (for C, Doxygen-formatted comments are used).

A DLD describes

* data-structures,
* programming interfaces,
* functions,
* concurrency,
* scope and ownership data objects,
* data and control flow,
* deployment procedures (install, upgrade, downgrade, removal, monitoring,
  logging, error reporting in the field, *etc*.).

A DLD contains enough detail to start coding. A DLD contains a refinement of the
testing and integration plans from the HLD.

Detailed-level design intermediate review (DLDIR)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Creation of a complex DLD can be periodically informally reviewed (**by ...**)
to assure that it goes in the right direction.

Detailed-level design inspection (DLDINSP)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A DLD is inspected. Inspection comments are recorded. The DLD authors discuss
and address the comments. The DLD is updated. The inspection process is repeated
until all found issues are addressed.

**Question**: how and where DLD inspection comments are recorded?

**Proposal**: [nikita]: an inspection round is recorded as a separate commit,
 with questions directly embedded in the DLD. git diff will show the
 context. The answers and requests for clarification are added as a next
 commit. Then another next commit contains the new version of the DLD, with
 comments and answers removed (but preserved in the repository history).

Code (CODE)
+++++++++++

Coding populates the set of skeleton source files, created at the DLD stage with
the implementation conforming to the design. The code contains the set of tests,
according to the testing plan specified in the designs.

At the completion of the code phase, the design is implemented to the
satisfaction of the inspectors.

Code intermediate review (CODEIR)
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

A long code phase can be periodically informally reviewed (**by ...**) to assure
that it goes in the right direction.

Dev testing (TEST)
++++++++++++++++++

Developers execute tests, created as part of the code phase, and fix all the
test failures.

Test runs and failure analyses are recorded in the tracking file (either
directly or by reference to a testing platform (jenkins, ci, *etc*.)).

Code inspection (CODEINSP)
++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Code is inspected. Inspection comments are recorded. Code authors discuss and
address the comments. Code is updated. The inspection process is repeated until
all found issues are addressed.

Documentation (DOC)
+++++++++++++++++++

Necessary documentation is created, reviewed and inspected concurrently with the
designs and code.

Integration (INT)
+++++++++++++++++

Integration happens according to the integration plan developed at the planning
phase and refined (for this task) at the design and coding phases.

Integration includes execution of integration and end-to-end tests involving the
task.

Integration completes with landing the designs and the code onto the appropriate
branch.

A group of tasks can be integrated together (this should be specified in the
integration plan).

QA testing (QA)
+++++++++++++++

QA team tests the landed tasks according to the planned QA plan.

A group of tasks can be QAed together (this should be specified in the
QA plan).

Deployment (DEPLOY)
+++++++++++++++++++

Once the task has been tested by QA it can be deployed in the field (as part of
a product). Deployment phase includes necessary modifications to the product
packages, manifests, BOMs, *etc*., installation procedures and responding to
customer bug reports related to the task.

A group of tasks can be deployed together (this should be specified in the
deployment plan).

Patents (PATENTS)
+++++++++++++++++

If any, IP disclosures are filed concurrently with the other task execution
stages.

Abandoned (ABANDON)
-------------------

A development can be retired when no longer needed. Its tracking file and
artefacts are preserved.

Pseudo-code
===========

The development process can be represented by the following pseudo-code:

.. highlight:: C
.. code-block:: C

   development(input) {
	do {
		input = clarify(input);
	} while (!clarified);
	development = analysis(input);
	development.reqs = requirements(development);
	arch = architecture(development, arch);
	plan = planning(development);
	for (task in plan) {
		task_process(task) &;
	}
   }

.. highlight:: C
.. code-block:: C

   task_process(task) {
	task.reqs = task_requirements(task.development, task);
	document(task) &;
	patent(task) &;
	do {
	   do {
	      task.hld = hld(task);
	      task.hld = hldir(task.hld);
	   } while (!complete(task.hld));
	   issues = hldinsp(task.hld);
	} while (issues != nil);
	do {
	   do {
	      task.dld = dld(task);
	      task.dld = dldir(task.dld);
	   } while (!complete(task.dld));
	   issues = dldinsp(task.dld);
	} while (issues != nil);
	do {
	   do {
	      task.code = code(task);
	      task.code = codeir(task.code);
	   } while (!complete(task.code));
           task.code = devtests(task);
	   issues = codeinsp(task.code);
	} while (issues != nil);
	integration(task);
	qa(task);
	deploy(task);
   }


Notes
=====

* This document is itself managed by the process it describes.

* This development process can be adjusted as needed. States can be omitted,
  added, re-ordered, as necessary by the agreement of the stakeholders.

* The development owner and the list of development stakeholders can be changed
  during development to accommodate for changes in circumstances or additional
  information.

* Artefacts, created as part of this process (tracking files, design documents,
  and so on) are kept under version control in the Project repository. If
  possible, they are formatted as reStructured text files pre-processed by the
  Project build system with a common set of m4 macros (as this file is). If this
  format is not suitable, the artefacts should be in a format that allows easy
  search, meaningful version control and links to particular items within a
  document. Artefacts should be in the English language and follow standard
  conventions of the Project: British spelling, no Oxford comma, *etc*. (see
  doc/coding-style.md).
