* Usecases
** Happy path
** 1 transient failure of persistent participant and subsequent DTM recovery
** 1 transient failure of persistent participant and subsequent another 1 subsequent failure during recovery
** n transient failures of originators
** n transient failures of originators and k failures of persistent participants
** DTM recovery stop
** DTM during persistent failures
** DTM transaction abort (cancelation of clovis operation)
** Clovis interface w.r.t. distributed transactions
C-level interface
Affected clovis calls
** HA callbacks
** DTM Log truncation
** Dependency tracking (explicit and inexplicit)
** DTM message delivery diring failures
deliver executed callback after persistent participant failure
** DTM transaction and record versions
