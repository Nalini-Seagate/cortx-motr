     - LR cluster must support Seagate 5U84 RBOD enclosures running the ADAPT
       firmware with 16TB, 18TB and 20TB drives. Future: support largest drives
       available from Seagate
     - The largest capacity drives available from Seagate must be supported also

   * - **scenario name**
     - [u.hw-10.full-storage-time]
   * - **context**
     - cortx system test
   * - **trigger**
     - an enclosure is to be filled up completely by the tests to verify "no
       space" conditions.
   * - **requirements**
     - filling an enclosure should take reasonable time. It should be estimated.
   * - **interaction**
     - Estimate fill-up time.
