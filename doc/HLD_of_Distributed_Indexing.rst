High level design of the distributed indexing
=====================================================

This document presents a high level design (HLD) of the Motr distributed indexing. The main purposes of this document are: (i) to be inspected by the Motr architects and peer designers to ascertain that high level design is aligned with Motr architecture and other designs, and contains no defects, (ii) to be a source of material for Active Reviews of Intermediate Design (ARID) and detailed level design (DLD) of the same component, (iii) to serve as a design reference document.

The intended audience of this document consists of Motr customers, architects, designers and developers.

**************
Introduction
**************

Distributed indexing is a Motr component that provides key-value indices distributed over multiple storage devices and network nodes in the cluster for performance, scalability and fault tolerance.

Distributed indices are exported via interface and provide applications with a method to store application-level meta-data. Distributed indices are also used internally by Motr to store certain internal meta-data. Distributed indexing is implemented on top of "non-distributed indexing" provided by the catalogue service (cas).

************
Definitions
************

- definitions from the high level design of catalogue service are included: catalogue, identifier, record, key, value, key order, user; 

- definitions from the high level design of parity de-clustered algorithm are included: pool, P, N, K, spare slot, failure vector;

- a distributed index, or simply index is an ordered container of key-value records;

- a component catalogue of a distributed index is a non-distributed catalogue of key-value record, provided by the catalogue service, in which the records of the distributed index are stored.

**************
Requirements
**************

- [r.idx.entity]: an index is a Clovis entity with a fid. There is a fid type for distributed indices;

- [r.idx.layout]: an index has a layout attribute, which determines how the index is stored in non-distributed catalogues;

- [r.idx.pdclust]: an index is stored according to a parity de-clustered layout with N = 1, i.e., some form of replication. The existing parity de-clustered code is re-used;

- [r.idx.hash]: partition of index records into parity groups is done via key hashing. The hash of a key determines the parity group (in the sense of parity de-clustered layout algorithm) and, therefore, the location of all replicas and spare spaces;

- [r.idx.hash-tune]: the layout of an index can specify one of the pre-determined hash functions and specify the part of the key used as the input for the hash function. This provides an application with some degree of control over locality;

- [r.idx.cas]: indices are built on top of catalogues and use appropriately extended catalogue service;

- [r.idx.repair]: distributed indexing sub-system has a mechanism of background repair. In case of a permanent storage failure, index repair restores redundancy by generating more replicas in spare space;

- [r.idx.re-balance]: distributed indexing sub-system has a mechanism of background re-balance. When a replacement hardware element (a device, a node, a rack) in added to the system, re-balance copies appropriate replicas from the spare space to the replacement unit;

- [r.idx.repair.reuse]: index repair and re-balance, if possible, are built on top of copy machine abstraction used by the SNS repair and re-balance;

- [r.idx.degraded-mode]: access to indices is possible during repair and re-balance;

- [r.idx.root-index]: a root index is provided, which has a known built-in layout and, hence, can be accessed without learning its layout first. The root index is stored in a pre-determined pool, specified in the configuration data-base. The root index contains a small number of global records;

- [r.idx.layout-index]: a layout index is provided, which contains (key: index-fid, value: index-layout-id) records for all indices except the root index, itself and other indices mentioned in the root index. The layout of the layout index is stored in the root index. Multiple indices can use the same layout-id;

- [r.idx.layout-descr]: a layout descriptor index is provided, which contains (key: index-layout-id, value: index-layout-descriptor) records for all indices;

Relevant requirements from the Motr Summary Requirements table:

- [r.m0.cmd]: clustered meta-data are supported;

- [r.m0.layout.layid]: a layout is uniquely identified by a layout id (layid);

- [r.m0.layout.meta-data]: layouts for meta-data are supported.

******************
Design Highlights
******************

An index is stored in a collection of catalogues, referred to as component catalogues (similarly to a component object, cob), distributed across the pool according to the index layout. Individual component catalogues are either created during explicit index creation operation or created lazily on the first access.

To access the index record with a known key, the hash of the key is calculated and used as the data unit index input of parity de-clustered layout algorithm. The algorithm outputs the locations of N+K component catalogues, where the replicas of the record are located and S component catalogues that hold spare space for the record. Each component catalogue stores a subset of records of the index without any transformation of keys or values.

Iteration through an index from a given starting key is implementing by querying all component catalogues about records following the key and merge-sorting the results. This requires updating catalogue service to correctly handle NEXT operation with a non-existent starting key.

New fid type is registered for index fids.

Functional Specification

Indices are available through Clovis interface. Spiel and HA interfaces are extended to control repair and re-balance of indices.

Index Layouts
===============

Index layouts are based on N+K+S parity de-clustered layout algorithm, with the following modifications:

- N = 1. The layout provides (K+1)-way replication;

- parity de-clustered layouts for data objects come with unit size as a parameter. Unit size is used to calculate parity group number, which is an essential input to the parity de-clustered layout function. For indices there is no natural way to partition key-space into units, so the implementation should provide some flexibility to select suitable partitioning. One possible (but not mandated) design is calculate unit number by specifying an identity mask within a key:

 - identity mask is a sequence of ranges of bit positions in index key (keys are considered as bit-strings): [S0, E0], [S1, E1], ..., [Sm, Em], here Si and Ei are bit-offsets counted from 0. The ranges can be empty, overlapping and are not necessarily monotone offset-wise;

 - given a key bit-string X, calculate its seed as

   - seed = X[S0, E0]::X[S1, E1]:: ... :: X[Sm, Em

   where :: is bit-string concatenation

 - if the layout is hashed (a Boolean parameter), then the key belongs to the parity group hash(seed), where hash is some fixed hash function, otherwise (not hashed), the parity group number equals seed, which must not exceed 64 bits;

 - the intention is that if it is known that some parts of keys of a particular index have good statistical properties, e.g., are generated as a sequential counter, these parts of the key can be included in the identity mask of a non-hashed layout. In addition, some parts of a key can be omitted from the identity mask to improve locality of reference, so that "close" keys are stored in the same component catalogue, increasing the possibility of network aggregation. Note that a user can always use a hash function tailored for a particular index by appending arbitrary hash values to the keys.

A few special cases require special mention:

- redundant, but not striped layout is a layout with the empty identity mask. In an index with such layout, all records belong to the same parity group. As a result, the index is stored in (K+1) component catalogues. The location of the next record is known in advance and iteration through the index can be implemented without broadcasting all component catalogues. The layout provides fault-tolerance, but doesn't provide full scalability within a single index, specifically the total size of an index is bound by the size of the storage controlled by a single catalogue service. Note, however that different indices with the same layout will use different sets of services;

- fully hashed layout is a layout with infinite identity mask [0, +âˆž] and with "hashed" attribute true. Records of an index with such layout are uniformly distributed across the entire pool. This layout is the default layout for "generic" indices;

- fid index layout. It is expected that there will be many indices using fids as keys. The default hash function should work effectively in this case. Similarly for the case of an index, where a 64-bit unsigned integer is used as a key;

- lingua franca layout is the layout type optimised for storing lingua franca namespace indices, by hashing filename part of the key and omitting attributes from the hash.

Layout descriptor is the set of parameters necessary to do index operations. Layout descriptor consists of:

- storage pool version fid. Component catalogues of an index using the layout are stored in the pool version. Pool version object is stored in confc and contains, among other attributes, N, K, and P;

- identity mask, as described above;

- hashed flag, as described above (or the identifier of a hash function to use for this layout, if multiple hash functions are supported);

- for uniformity, layout descriptors are also defined for catalogues (i.e., non-distributed indices). A catalogue layout descriptor consists of the fid of the service hosting the catalogue.

Typically a layout descriptor will be shared by a large number of indices. To reduce the amount of meta-data, a level of indirection is introduced, see the Internal meta-data sub-section below.

In-memory representation of a clovis index includes index fid and index layout descriptor.
